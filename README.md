# SCLE: sensible command line environment

For the sensitive people. By sensitive individuals.

I will propose a set from at most only NIX/GNU-friendly programs and at most
only POSIX shell scripts to interact well with.  But still, it is good to read
their manuals (GNU's are astonishing) and to learn above your sensibility.

# HTYI

_How Too Use It ?_

1. I add `./scls/scripts` to my shell's PATH environement variable
2. if a script does'nt have execution permission I read `./scls/configure`

# Rocking programs

- `screen - screen manager with VT100/ANSI terminal emulation`;
- `fzf - a command-line fuzzy finder` and alternatively,
- `fzy - a fuzzy text selector menu for the terminal`

# Miscellenaous programs

- `mcee - task master for work ceremonies`

# Sensible Scripts

- `scls.sh -  screen clear; screen list`
- `mc.sh - wrapper to use mcee`
- `fc.sh - fc-list fonts family names`
- `path.sh - list POSIX path`
