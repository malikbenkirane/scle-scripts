# SCLE: sensible command line environment

For the sensitive people. By sensitive individuals.

I will propose a set from at most only NIX/GNU-friendly programs and at most
only POSIX shell scripts to interact well with.  But still, it is good to read
their manuals (GNU's are astonishing) and to learn above your sensibility.

# Rocking programs

- `screen - screen manager with VT100/ANSI terminal emulation`

# Sensible Scripts

- `scls.sh -  screen clear; screen list`
